**Roblox Developers - Rules**

:one: **Respect other members.** This means __no hate speech__, __racist__, __sexist__, __or otherwise discriminating speech__ towards other members.
Swearing is allowed, as long as it doesn’t breach this rule.
If you have a problem with another member, try to resolve it via DMs, or open a ticket at #report-a-user.

:two: **No advertising** – do not advertise your games or discord servers here, either via DMs or directly in the server. It’s annoying. Doing this will result in a kick or ban.

Exception
Games and servers are allowed to be posted in <#639853915080359936>, and in the help channels as long as they have something to do with that channel.
Recommending games to others is allowed, within reason.

:three: **No spam, NSFW or generally obnoxious content.**
Slowmode is enabled in some channels to help with this, but it’s not a perfect system. Repeatedly posting the same message even in these channels will result in a warn.

:four: **Use channels for their intended use.** Don’t talk in <#639853915080359936>, <#746833399175577601>, <#756620959720407141>, <#756621092801609888>, <#756621111722246225>, ... **Do not DM other members for help**, even staff, unless granted permission by that person. Don’t ask for help in #chat, don’t post your epic memes in #new-members.
If you have a question about a channel, feel free to ask a staff member.

:five: **Always listen to moderators.** Moderators have the right to warn you if they think you did something wrong. So listen to them!

:six: **Discord ToS is enforced,** so don’t break their rules or you will be punished.
We **can not** and **do not** enforce **Roblox ToS**. If you have a problem with their services, go to roblox.com/support

:seven: If you’d like to partner with our server, read the guidelines in <#640578815902482433> and open a ticket from that channel.

:eight: We may take down offers or content which are suspicious/immoral/very likely scams, such as robux generators or selling free models.


**Mods may use their discretion when enforcing rules.**
These rules are still in progress. If a mod or admin asks you to stop doing something, listen to them.

**Tip to help avoid getting scammed:** before you start work, get part of your payment given to you, and the rest after the work is done.

**We cannot do anything about scams,** but if someone is threatening the safety of the server, such as by repeatedly scamming, they will be banned.

Rules are subject to change without notice.
